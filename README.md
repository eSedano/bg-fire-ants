## Definitions

* **Reserve**: The stones close to a player, still not played on the board.
* **Buffer space**: Each of the 18 dark gray hexes on the board. Pieces can only be placed in buffer spaces when brough from the reserve or from another buffer space.
* **Regular space**: Each of the 37 white hexes on the board.

## How to play
### Actions
On their turn, players take one of the following actions:
* **Place a new stone**: Bring a stone from the reserve to an unoccupied buffer space.
* **Change buffer space**: Move a stone in a buffer space to another, unoccupied one.
* **Move a stone**: Move a stone from a buffer space or a regular space according to the stones' rules of movement.
* **Move a queen**: Move a queen on a regular space according to the queens' rules of movement.

### Rules of movement

#### Stones
Stones move in a straight line across the edges of the hexes, moving as far as possible. A stone's movement only stops when the next space is occupied by another piece or queen, or there are no more regular spaces to move to.

The following figure shows all possible moves for stone A, which would finish its movement in any of the spaces marked with an X.

The figure below shows all possible moves for stone A which, starting from a buffer space, could finish its movement in any of the spaces marked with an X.

### Queens

Queens also move in a straight line across the edges of the hexes. Unlike stones, queens are allowed to finish their movement on any regular space along the line of movement. The figure below shows all possible destination spaces for queen A marked with an X.
